Class - Basic Problem
Problem:
Create a class called Car with the following properties:

brand (String)

year (int)

speed (int)

Add methods to:

Accelerate (increase speed)

Brake (decrease speed)

Display the car details.

Write a main method to create a Car object, modify its speed, and display its details.

2. Interface - Basic Problem
Problem:
Define an interface called Playable with these methods:

play()

pause()

stop()

Create two classes, MusicPlayer and VideoPlayer, that implement the Playable interface differently.

In the main method, create objects of both classes and call their methods.

3. Abstract Class - Basic Problem
Problem:
Create an abstract class Shape with:

An abstract method double area()

An abstract method double perimeter()

A method void displayInfo() that prints "This is a shape."

Then:

Create concrete classes Circle and Rectangle that extend Shape.

Implement the area() and perimeter() methods in each class.

Write a main method that creates a Circle and a Rectangle, and displays their area and perimeter.

4. Combined Practice - Class, Interface, Abstract Class
Problem:

Create an interface Movable with method move().

Create an abstract class Animal with:

Property name

Abstract method makeSound()

Create classes Dog and Bird that:

Extend Animal

Implement Movable

Implement makeSound() and move() in both classes differently.

In the main method:

Create a Dog and Bird.

Call their makeSound() and move() methods.
